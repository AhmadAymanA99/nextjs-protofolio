## Introduction:
Covid-19 is one of the most dangerous things that happened to us, it affected many people and will most likely continue to affect more therefore the public need to have awareness and understanding of the importance of everyone's role. 
Mathematics help create a story, or a form of representation to predict the behavior of the disease because numbers always don't lie and it is better to prevent diseases rather than to try to find cures for them after they occur. The reasoning for that is like why you change the oil in your car rather than wait to fix a blown engine.

### Motivation:
-	our role as developers.
-	awareness is more important than cure.
-	Reduced pressure on hospitals.

### Why this Project:
Only way to Fight this pandemic is by avoiding large gatherings and by not going to high infected rate areas.
