## Introduction:
The main objective of this web-based application is to provide an 
easy and simple way for the needy or the charitable 
organizations to request help either in Donation, Volunteering, 
or Recycling. Hence, donors or volunteers will search easily for 
the requested help they would like to offer or do.

### Motivation:
What makes us human is helping each other. People tend to help each 
other, and it will be great if they help the right person but most of the 
time they get deceived by others. There are a lot of charitable websites 
but each one specifies a certain field of donation (money, blood, etc.) 
and that makes it difficult for people to find a simple and easy way to 
donate in one website. Also, some people want to offer help, but they 
cannot find a fast way to donate.
